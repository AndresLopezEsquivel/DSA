# Binary Search Tree

* A full binary tree is a binary tree in which each node has exactly 0 or 2 children.
Example:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```
* A perfect binary tree is a binary tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level.
Example:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```
* A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled. It is filled from left to right with no gaps.
Example:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \ /
    4  5 6
```

Nodes without children are called leaves.
